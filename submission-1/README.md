## Instruction

Create a service in the form of a CLI to display data of your classmates. For example, when you run the command `go run biodata.go 1`, the data that will appear is the data of your friend with the number 1. The data that should be displayed are:
1. Name
2. Address
3. Occupation
4. Reason for choosing the Golang class

Use structs and functions to display this data.
You can use `os.Args` to get arguments in the terminal.
